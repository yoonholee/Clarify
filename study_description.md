# Interactively Correcting AI Model Errors

## Aim of the Study
The primary goal of this study is to understand the limitations and inaccuracies of a specific AI model in the domain of image classification. Your insights will help us identify common failure modes, thereby aiding in model improvement.

## Participant Tasks
- **Review Images**: You will be shown a series of images that our AI model has classified. Some classifications are correct, while others are not. Your task is to identify what the incorrect examples have in common.
- **Propose Descriptions**: Once you have an understanding of the model's inaccuracies, you will suggest short, descriptive phrases (1-3 words) that encapsulate these failure modes. For instance, if the model often misclassifies images containing water, you might write "pond" or "water."
- **Inspect Results**: The study interface will then display new images based on your proposed attributes. You'll need to verify if these new images align with your initial observations.
You will repeat steps 2 and 3 at least 3 times for each task.

## Sensitive Information
No sensitive personal information is required for participation.

## Reward and Bonus Payments
Participants will be rewarded promptly upon successful submission. Additionally, a bonus of 50 cents will be given for accurately identifying true failure modes, up to a total of $1.

## Tips for Success
- Keep your descriptive phrases short; usually 1-2 words will suffice.
- Take your time to verify if the model's filtered images align with your initial observations to ensure you qualify for the bonus. A score **above our suggested goal** (which varies by task) will qualify for the bonus.
